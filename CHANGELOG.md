## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.3] - 2019-03-18

### Fixed

- Promise now rejects when the process terminates abnormally; with a non-zero
  exit code. Previously it simply resolved with the normal object, but having
  a non-zero status code. This caused tools such as gulp to think that the process
  was successful when it wasn't. As a result it would not fail builds correctly!

## [2.0.2] - 2019-03-15

### Fixed

- Include missing util files which were accidentally not included in the package
  due to the `files` field being too strict.

## [2.0.1] - 2019-03-15

### Fixed

- Resolved some design issues with [2.0.0], namely the fact that it lacked
  the ability to close processes that don't close on their own. The API
  now returns _both_ the reference to the process, which can be killed, and
  the promise added in [2.0.0]. This means that you can now kill the process with
  its respective object, and then await the promise and check its signal to ensure
  termination.

## [2.0.0] - 2019-03-14

### Changed

- The API is now promise-based, so instead of returning a `ChildProcess` object,
  the result of calling `spawn`, it now returns a `Promise<SpawnSyncReturns<Buffer>>`.
  This improves the user-experience by making it easier to wait for the process
  to finish and get its error code. However, it is a breaking change for anything
  depending on the raw `ChildProcess`.
- The user-provided options are now added to the defaults, with the user options
  having a higher priority, instead of naively overwriting them. This allows the
  user to easily specify an option like `cwd` without having to _also_ specify
  the defaults in this case.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-03-13

### Added

- Multiple commands can now be executed in a single shell instance. These
  can either be executed in series or in parallel, depending on which function
  is called.

## [1.0.1] - 2019-03-12

### Added

- Information about the project to the README

## [1.0.0] - 2019-03-12

### Added

- Created the basic project, which allows spawning of terminal commands.
